202010920 - Today I Learned: SQL WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY statments
20210921 - Today I Learned: Refreshed on creating a git repo, copy public key to to repo site (git lab), and cloned repo directory. We created new repo for the til.md file which I moved from the home directory to the a the new repo directory "my_data_science_notes", added/commit/pushed.
20210923 - I am changing this to "Yesterday I Learned" as an attempt to reinforce previous day's lesson. So, Yesterday I Learned: JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT which start with the FROM table and attaches columns with a JOIN table. Further modification of the query is RIGHT JOIN which includes all values from the FROM table or LEFT JOIN which includes all values from the JOIN table. SELECT parameters need to include table info.  Associative Tables and Join means to further attaching tables by shared keys like bridges.
20210924 - Yesterday I Learned: to self join a table by aliasing the FROM table and then JOIN the FROM table again under a new alias allows you to select values from eithe table. I also reieved clarificatin on the LEFT JOIN funcation as well as JOINing tables in meaningful way. I also learned the value of keeping things simple. I was trying to use the MAX funciton when ASC with LIMIT solved the answer.
20210927 - Friday was an off day for Codeup Department Off-Site
20210928 - Yesterday I Learned: About subqueries and temperary tables. Subqueries are used by embedding a query into another query. Nested querys are allowed. It helps to break down each subpart of teh query sepeatley and join them at the end. Temp Table is when you make a table under your session profile which means that it gets deleted when your session ends. The temp table is helpful in manipulating data wihtout actually writing any chages to the db.
201210929 - Yesterday I Learned: Temporary Tables and Case Statements. Temporary table exercise review emphasized to break down the problem into smaller/simpler problems and to push off the complicated to later. I have to stop looking for the fancy/comlicated solutions and go forward with what I know. We learned Case Statements that add conditions "when/then" and "if()" to the select statement. When/then are good for finding matches or <> ranges, and if() is good for true/false.
20210930 - Yesterday I Learned: during the Case Statement exercise review that a letter character can be used with an operator. I learned the importance of date stamping data. I learned that I need to practice more.
20211001 - Yesterday I Learned: during the SQL quiz review that WHERE Clause operator can be used with the field in the operation. I learned that a foriegn key must be linked to a primary key. This is confusing because a foriegn key doesn't need to be unique meaning there can be duplicates and it can also be null. How does a foreign key which can be null or a duplicate be linked to a primary key?  I recieved clarificatoin on the key relationships of one-to-many, many-to-one, and many_to_many. Must use the reverse to confirm. I learned the INSERT TO command into multiple columns. We also started Python section and learned about the origin of Python and the Anaconda environment. I learned that jupyter is a small local webserver that is interfacing with ipython.
20211004 - Yesterday I Learned: Data types, Variables, and Operators. I learned about string formatting with f'???" which I agree with Adam, looks beter to read. I learned the difference between function and method, that had confused me earlier on why some were attached to the object and for some the object was placed in the (). I learned .split and .join. I leared I need to practice more with dictionaries, they still confuse me.
20211005 - Yesterday I Learned: Control Structures. I exercisd with for loops, while loops, and continue, but I haven't implemented break effectivly yet. I learned how to use format() somewhat and I also used tabulate. I learned to write input() to validate the input.
20211006 - Yesterday I Learned: About Functions. Defined functions work as an instance with its variables only existing during said instance. Passing an argurment via function parameter in orde to process argument into a differnt output. Lamdas are a quick way to run a function if said functin is temporary.
20211007 - Yesterday I Learned: During the functions exercise to be generous with variables and steps. I try so hard to keep things minimal and "efficient" with less code that I ended up blocking my self for a long time. I was trying to convert a value directly into a new list which was working. When I converted a variable instead, and then appended said variable to a list then it worked fine.
2021108 - Yesterday I Learned: About Importing. Importing brings into memory, duriing my current session, code (function, method, variable) from a different file. It makes code cleaner. Python is popular because of all of the libraries (groups of modules) that have been made available by the community.
20211013 - Yesterday I Learned: About Matplotlib. I leared how to make charts, lines, legends, with formatting."
