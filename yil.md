202010920 - Today I Learned: SQL WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY statments
20210921 -- Today I Learned: Refreshed on creating a git repo, copy public key to to repo site (git lab), and cloned repo directory. We created new repo for the til.md file which I moved from the home directory to the a the new repo directory "my_data_science_notes", added/commit/pushed.
20210923 - I am changing this to "Yesterday I Learned" as an attempt to reinforce previous day's lesson. So, Yesterday I Learned: JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT which start with the FROM table and attaches columns with a JOIN table. Further modification of the query is RIGHT JOIN which includes all values from the FROM table or LEFT JOIN which includes all values from the JOIN table. SELECT parameters need to include table info.  Associative Tables and Join means to further attaching tables by shared keys like bridges.
20210924: Yesterday I Learned: to self join a table by aliasing the FROM table and then JOIN the FROM table again under a new alias allows you to select values from eithe table. I also reieved clarificatin on the LEFT JOIN funcation as well as JOINing tables in meaningful way. I also learned the value of keeping things simple. I was trying to use the MAX funciton when ASC with LIMIT solved the answer.
