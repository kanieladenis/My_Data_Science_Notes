202010920 - Today I Learned: SQL WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY statments
20210921 - Today I Learned: Refreshed on creating a git repo, copy public key to to repo site (git lab), and cloned repo directory. We created new repo for the til.md file which I moved from the home directory to the a the new repo directory "my_data_science_notes", added/commit/pushed.
20210923 - I am changing this to "Yesterday I Learned" as an attempt to reinforce previous day's lesson. So, Yesterday I Learned: JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT which start with the FROM table and attaches columns with a JOIN table. Further modification of the query is RIGHT JOIN which includes all values from the FROM table or LEFT JOIN which includes all values from the JOIN table. SELECT parameters need to include table info.  Associative Tables and Join means to further attaching tables by shared keys like bridges.
20210924 - Yesterday I Learned: to self join a table by aliasing the FROM table and then JOIN the FROM table again under a new alias allows you to select values from eithe table. I also reieved clarificatin on the LEFT JOIN funcation as well as JOINing tables in meaningful way. I also learned the value of keeping things simple. I was trying to use the MAX funciton when ASC with LIMIT solved the answer.
20210927 - Friday was an off day for Codeup Department Off-Site
20210928 - Yesterday I Learned: About subqueries and temperary tables. Subqueries are used by embedding a query into another query. Nested querys are allowed. It helps to break down each subpart of teh query sepeatley and join them at the end. Temp Table is when you make a table under your session profile which means that it gets deleted when your session ends. The temp table is helpful in manipulating data wihtout actually writing any chages to the db.
201210929 - Yesterday I Learned: Temporary Tables and Case Statements. Temporary table exercise review emphasized to break down the problem into smaller/simpler problems and to push off the complicated to later. I have to stop looking for the fancy/comlicated solutions and go forward with what I know. We learned Case Statements that add conditions "when/then" and "if()" to the select statement. When/then are good for finding matches or <> ranges, and if() is good for true/false.
20210930 - Yesterday I Learned: during the Case Statement exercise review that a letter character can be used with an operator. I learned the importance of date stamping data. I learned that I need to practice more.
