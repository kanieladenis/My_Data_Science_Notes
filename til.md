    SQL WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY statments
20210921: Today I Learned: 
    Refreshed on creating a git repo, copy public key to to repo site (git lab), and cloned repo directory. We created new repo for the til.md file which I moved from the home directory to the a the new repo directory "my_data_science_notes", added/commit/pushed.
    We learned the GROUP BY statement for SQL which agregates data into group and allows agregate computation (avg,sum,min,max,). We learned HAVING statment which allows manipulation of the the GROUP BY data. 
    We learned Functions CONCAT, SUBSTR, CAST, CURDATE(), NOW(), MIN, MAX, AVG
